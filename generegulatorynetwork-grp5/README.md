# Project Title

This project aims to construct and analyze a **Gene Regulatory Network (GRN)** from gene expression data using transcription factor (TF) interactions. It helps in identifying regulatory relationships between genes and understanding biological pathways.
## 🚀 Features

- From gene expression data, we can find the relation between different types of transcription factors and genes.
- A diagram of network will be created.
- Three types of method can be used - Correlation analysis, Linear_Regression and Lasso_Regression
- This project gives us flexibility to change the thresholds, for choosing positive regulation, and negative regulation.
## ⚙️ Methods

- Data preprocessing (normalization, filtering)
- Three methods, correlation analysis, linear regression and lasso regression.
- Identification of TF-target relationships
- Graph construction using NetworkX
- Visualization and centrality analysis
### Dataset
  we used https://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca/ site for downloading the database of human transcription factors, and saving the name of all transcription factors in a 
  txt file
