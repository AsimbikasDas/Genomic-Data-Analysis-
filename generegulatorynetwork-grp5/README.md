# Project Title

This project aims to construct and analyze a **Gene Regulatory Network (GRN)** from gene expression data using transcription factor (TF) interactions. It helps in identifying regulatory relationships between genes and understanding biological pathways.
## üöÄ Features

- From gene expression data, we can find the relation between different types of transcription factors and genes.
- A diagram of network will be created.
- Three types of method can be used - Correlation analysis, Linear_Regression and Lasso_Regression
- This project gives us flexibility to change the thresholds, for choosing positive regulation, and negative regulation.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

- Data preprocessing (normalization, filtering)
- Three methods, correlation analysis, linear regression and lasso regression.
- Identification of TF-target relationships
- Graph construction using NetworkX
- Visualization and centrality analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
